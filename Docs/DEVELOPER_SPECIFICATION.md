---

## AI Integration

### Google Gemini API
- Model: gemini-1.5-flash
- Conversation-based analysis
- System prompts guide AI behavior
- History maintained in frontend (not persisted)

### Flow
1. User sends message via `/api/ai/chat`
2. Backend adds system prompt (first message only)
3. Conversation history sent to Gemini API
4. AI responds with color analysis or questions
5. Frontend displays response
6. When analysis requested, special prompt triggers season determination
7. AI responds with season (spring/summer/autumn/winter)
8. Frontend parses response and offers to save season to profile

### Prompts
- **System Prompt**: Guides AI to act as color analysis expert, ask questions about appearance
- **Analysis Prompt**: Instructs AI to determine season based on conversation and provide explanation

---


### Limitations
- Railway blocks outbound SMTP (no email in production)
- Solution: Use email API (SendGrid, Resend) or run backend locally for password recovery

## Security Considerations

The application implements multiple layers of security to protect user data and prevent common web vulnerabilities.

### 1. SQL Injection Prevention

The application uses Sequelize ORM to prevent SQL injection attacks. Sequelize automatically uses parameterized queries, ensuring user input is never directly concatenated into SQL statements. All queries are sanitized before execution, making it impossible for attackers to inject malicious SQL code into database queries.

### 2. Password Hashing

Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with a cost factor of 10, which means each password goes through 2^10 (1024) iterations of the hashing algorithm. This makes password cracking computationally expensive and protects against password theft in case of database breaches, rainbow table attacks, and brute force attacks. Passwords are irreversibly transformed and stored as 200-character hashes that cannot be reversed to obtain the original password.

### 3. Automatic Password Salting

Each password receives a unique random salt that is automatically generated by bcrypt. The salt is embedded in the hash string, ensuring that identical passwords for different users produce completely different hashes. This protects against rainbow table attacks and makes it impossible to detect password patterns across users, even if the database is compromised.

### 4. JWT Token Authentication

The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with HS256 algorithm for stateless authentication. Tokens are cryptographically signed with a secret key and contain user data plus an expiration timestamp. Each protected route request is verified for valid signature and expiration. This protects against session hijacking, CSRF attacks, and unauthorized API access without requiring server-side session storage.


### 5. Secure Password Recovery

Password recovery uses a two-step security process. First, a 32-byte random token is generated using Node's crypto library, which provides cryptographically secure randomness. The token is then hashed with bcrypt before being stored in the database. Only the plain token is sent to the user's email for one-time use. Tokens automatically expire after 24 hours and are permanently deleted after successful password reset. This protects against token guessing attacks, token reuse, and unlimited validity exploits.

### 6. CORS Protection

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured to only allow requests from whitelisted origins. In production, only the Vercel frontend URL is permitted; in development, localhost is allowed. The browser automatically blocks any requests from unauthorized domains, protecting against unauthorized cross-origin requests and preventing malicious websites from stealing user data.

### 7. Multi-Layer Input Validation

The application implements three layers of input validation. The Vue.js frontend validates required fields, email format, and password length before sending requests. Backend controllers verify data types, string lengths, and format patterns such as email addresses and hex color codes. Finally, the MySQL database schema enforces NOT NULL constraints, UNIQUE constraints, and foreign key relationships. This multi-layer approach protects against invalid data insertion, XSS attacks, and format-based exploits.

### 8. JWT Token Expiration

All JWT tokens automatically expire after 24 hours. The authentication middleware verifies token expiration on every protected route request. When a token expires, the frontend automatically logs out the user and requires re-authentication. This protects against token replay attacks and limits the damage from stolen tokens, as they become useless after 24 hours.

### 9. Database Referential Integrity

MySQL foreign key constraints enforce referential integrity throughout the database. The relationship between account and color_seasons uses ON DELETE SET NULL, which preserves the user account even if their assigned season is removed. The relationship between account and favorite_colors uses ON DELETE CASCADE, which automatically removes all favorite colors when a user account is deleted. These constraints prevent orphaned records and maintain data consistency.

### Color Season Analysis Terms

**Why Color Season Analysis?**

Color season analysis helps individuals identify which color palettes enhance their natural features, making them look more vibrant, healthy, and harmonious. By understanding their season, users can make informed decisions about clothing, makeup, and accessories, creating a cohesive personal style that maximizes their natural beauty. This eliminates guesswork in shopping, reduces wardrobe mistakes, and builds confidence in personal appearance.

![Season alanysis color wheel](../Media/spec/color_wheel.jpg)

**Color Season** - Classification system that categorizes individuals into four seasonal types (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter) based on their natural coloring.

**Spring Season** - Warm, bright, and clear color palette. Characteristics: golden undertones, light and warm colors, high contrast. Best colors: peach, coral, golden yellow, turquoise.

**Summer Season** - Cool, soft, and muted color palette. Characteristics: blue undertones, soft and cool colors, low contrast. Best colors: lavender, dusty rose, soft blue, cool gray.

**Autumn Season** - Warm, deep, and muted color palette. Characteristics: golden undertones, rich and earthy colors, medium contrast. Best colors: rust, olive green, warm brown, burnt orange.

**Winter Season** - Cool, bright, and clear color palette. Characteristics: blue undertones, bold and icy colors, high contrast. Best colors: pure white, black, emerald green, royal blue.

**Undertone** - The subtle hue beneath the skin's surface, either warm (golden/yellow) or cool (blue/pink). Determines the fundamental temperature of colors that suit a person.

**Color Temperature** - Classification of colors as warm (containing yellow) or cool (containing blue). Warm seasons are Spring and Autumn; cool seasons are Summer and Winter.

**Color Intensity** - How bright or muted a color appears. Spring and Winter have bright, clear colors; Summer and Autumn have soft, muted colors.

**Contrast** - The difference between a person's hair, skin, and eye colors. High contrast suits Spring and Winter; low contrast suits Summer and Autumn.

**Hex Color Code** - Six-digit hexadecimal representation of a color in format #RRGGBB, where RR (red), GG (green), and BB (blue) range from 00 to FF. Used to store users' favorite colors precisely in the database.

**Color Palette** - Collection of colors that harmonize with a person's natural coloring based on their assigned season.
